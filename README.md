# Twitch CLI
So if you're a nifty power user and most likely use livestreamer to watch some twitch streams,
you still probably have to navigate to twitch.tv to look up streams that are online or just cycle through livestreamer prompts to get info on twitch streams.

That's a really clumsy and slow way to get information from twitch. Why can't we just use the command line to get that info so we don't even have to open a web page to know what streams we want to watch? Hence the twitch CLI tool.

the twitch CLI is a simple set of scripts that simply fetch your follows from twitch and shows it to you for easy use of livestreamer.
