# Twitch CLI
So if you're a nifty power user and most likely use livestreamer to watch some twitch streams because that's what nifty power user use,
you still probably have to navigate to twitch.tv to look up streams that are online or just cycle through livestreame prompts to get info on twitch streams.

That's a really clumsy and slow way to get information from twitch. Why can't we just use the command line to get that info so we don't even have to open a web page to know what streams we want to watch? Hence the twitch CLI tool.
