# Twitch CLI
So if you're a nifty power user and most likely use livestreamer to watch some twitch streams,
you still probably have to navigate to twitch.tv to look up streams that are online or just cycle through livestreamer prompts to get info on twitch streams.

That's a really clumsy and slow way to get information from twitch. Why can't we just use the command line to get that info so we don't even have to open a web page to know what streams we want to watch? Hence the twitch CLI tool.

the twitch CLI is a simple tool that fetches your follows from twitch and spits it back at you, which in turn should allow easy use of livestreamer then (no need to alt-tab to a browser to check online streams, etc)..


## Intstallation and Setup 
The twitch CLI tool utilizies the twitch api of which documentation can be foundhere [insert link]. client configuration is stored in cfg/config.yaml. 

Since the tool is written in ruby as a way to teach myself, you will need to have ruby installed. You can just fetch the latest version from your package manager or repository of your choice. you can also install it from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
